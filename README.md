# Command-Injection
Command Injection is Different from Code Injection.

Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

COMMIX
(COMMandInjection eXploitation).This  toolsupports  a  plethora  of  functionalities,  in  order  to  cover  several exploitation  scenarios. Moreover,  Commixis  capable  ofdetecting,  with  high  success  rate, whether  a  web  application  is  vulnerable  to  command  injection  attacks. Finally,  during  the evaluation of the tool we have detected several 0-day vulnerabilities in applications.
